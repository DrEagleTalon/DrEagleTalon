# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DrEagleTalon  

## About Me  
I'm a self-taught engineer and lifelong learner with nearly 15 years of experience in electrical and PLC programming. My expertise spans controls, automation, robotics, machine learning, and 3D printing. Iâ€™m a self-starter who believes in the power of curiosity and continuous growth to achieve excellence.  

Outside the technical world, Iâ€™m a writer, blogger, and activist. I've authored books, run a successful blog, and manage a Substack where I share insights on technology, engineering, and working-class advocacy.  

Iâ€™m also proud to serve as one of the admins on Redditâ€™s [r/PLC](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC), fostering a vibrant community for PLC professionals and enthusiasts.  

As a Muslim, father, and nonprofit leader, Iâ€™m deeply committed to mutual aid and working-class solidarity. My nonprofit work focuses on helping people navigate challenges through grassroots support, staying clear of partisan politics to focus on common ground and shared humanity.  

## Projects and Collaboration  
Iâ€™m open to collaborating on:  
- Open-source projects related to PLC programming, Python, SQL, and PowerShell.  
- Controls and automation solutions.  
- Technical writing, reference guides, and articles.
